            <h3>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
            <p>This project is collecting a dataset with elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS. Using this dataset, the code determines the best location to wait in order to minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

            <h3>Assignment 3: SVD Preprocessing on MNIST with Logistic Regression
            <p>In this assignment, you'll use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to preprocess the MNIST dataset, training a logistic regression classifier and comparing performance across different SVD components. You'll implement SVD with NumPy, measure accuracy and efficiency, and visualize results to identify the optimal number of components.
